f_global_messages contains messages that everybody sees in every forum, at the
top of each forum thread list. There is a FIXED limit of 32 global messages
(see note below about reusing old global message slots).

Unlike a normal message, global messages are not linked to an account id,
and they don't contain any text. They are simply clickable urls.

f_global_message columns are
    gid: integer from 0-31 - MUST BE UNIQUE
    subject: just like a thread subject
    url: when you click on the subject, it will send you DIRECTLY here
    name: just like a message "name" - the user "name" of who posted this.
    date: will show up next to subject/name
    state: Inactive global messages are only visible to admins

Normal users can:
    "rm" (remove aka mark read)
    "Restore global messages" (un-remove removed messages)

Administrators can:
    see "inactive" global messages
    "ug" (undelete global message aka mark active)
    "dg" (delete global message aka mark inactive)
    "ed" (edit global message)

You can access the admin page at http://your.site.com/admin/gmessage.phtml
    From there, you can:

    * Edit global messages (subject/url)
      Note that the url can be *relative*, e.g.,
      "http://site.com/other/msgs/1234" can be abbreviated
      "/other/msgs/1234.phtml". This way, you can make links internal to your
      forum, especially if several hostnames can be used to access the forum
      (or both http and https).

    * Take "ownership" of a global message (set name)

    * Update the date of a global message (touch)

    * Change the status (active/inactive) of a global message

    * Reset all users "filter" bit for a global message, so the message is
      "unhidden" aka un-"remove" or unmark as "read" for EVERY user.
