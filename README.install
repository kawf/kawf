Quick setup guide:
------------------

* Unpack into a known location

* OPTIONAL - copy the contents of the configuration directory into a place
  where the apache server can get to (e.g. /var/www/forums/my.forum/config)

  You may also leave it in place.

* Edit config/setup.inc or create config/setup-local.inc to override setup.inc
  - set $domain to the domain where your forums are
  - you may want to create setup-local.inc to avoid merge problems if you are
    using source control on a live tree.

* Add a sql user in your sql db (e.g. "kawf" or "forums")
  - add a password for that user (in mysql, make sure to use the PASSWORD
    function to encrypt it!)

* Create a database (e.g. "kawf")

* Give the user above complete access to that database (including host
  information!)

* Edit config/config.inc or create config/config-local.inc
  - set $sql_username to the users you decided on above (e.g. "kawf" or
    "forums")
  - set $sql_password to the password you decided on above.
    ***********************************************************************
    * Note that this will be in plaintext, so make sure config.inc and/or
    * config-local.inc isn't world readable!
    ***********************************************************************
  - set $database to the database you decided on above (e.g. "kawf")
  - set $bounce_host to the server to which you want failed emails to go to
  - set $cookie_host to to domain you want saved in cookies - it MUST match a
    subset of the url host your users will use to access the forums!
  - you may way to create config-local.inc to avoid merge problems if you are
    using source control on a live tree.

* Edit tools/initial.php
  - make sure $include_path contains the location of your config.inc
  - go to the "tools" directory and type "./initial.php"

* Copy/edit sample-apache.conf to reflect the path pointing to your /config
  directory.
  - either "Include" your apache.conf file from the main http.conf, or
    cut/paste it in directly
  - for plesk vhosts, you can copy it directly into the vhosts.conf after
    removing the <VirtualHosts> tags.

* Restart apache

* Try to hit "http://site/create.phtml" where "site" is the domain where "site"
  is the domain you set up in setup-local.inc. Make sure it matches your DNS
  setup, or nothing will work right.

* If you cannot hit "create.phtml", something went wrong above.

* Create an account using "http://site/create.phtml". MAKE SURE "$domain" is
  set correctly in your setup-local.inc, or the link you will be emailed will
  have the wrong host in it.

* Click on the email to create your account. If you don't get the email, make
  sure you can send email from your server.

* Give yourself admin permissions.
  - go to "http://site/admin/"
  - click on "User ACL"
  - click on "Add new user ACL"
  - fill in "aid: 1", "fid: -1", and click all the check marks
  - click "Add"

* Create a test forum.
  - go back to "http://site/admin/"
  - click on "Add new forum", "Long Name: Test", "Short Name: test", and click
    all the check boxes
  - click "Add"

* now, go to your newly created test forum using "http://site/test/"!

* run tools/nightly.php often, or add it to a cronjob
